# Sonoff-Arduino_IDE
This is just my small tweak to Theo Arends' excellent package.
Please see Theo's original package and original README for details:-
https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-MQTT-OTA-Arduino

##What's this then?
This version simply adds .h files with function prototypes, as well as a minor pre-processor clause to reset the MQTT default parameters to Theo's recommended values without having to modify the actual library file.  This should be a simple, drop-in replacement which will compile for most people without any further changes.

All the mistakes are mine.  All of the brilliant, original work is Theo's.

##In brief...
Theo Arends' replacement for the original Sonoff firmware.  Theo's version implements MQTT and OTA programming, as well as  versatile user interfaces (MQTT, serial console and button).
